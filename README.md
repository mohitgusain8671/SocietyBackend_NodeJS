## Project Description
<a name="project-description"></a>
The primary objective of this project is to develop a module for our college societies. The website serves as a 
comprehensive platform to showcase the contributions and achievements of students, provide information about the 
society, list faculty coordinators and members, display testimonials, and advertise openings in the society and various other things.. The platform is built using the MERN stack, which includes
ReactJS, NodeJS, MySQL, and ExpressJS.

StudyNotion aims:
* To understand the fundamental components of society management.
* To explore effective practices for administrative management.
* To examine the role of technology in enhancing society management.
* To provide recommendations for improving society management 
systems.

In summary, Society Management is a versatile and intuitive tech platform that is designed to provide an immersive experience to students and a platform for society admins to maintain a complete record of their societies. In the following sections, we will delve into the technical details of the platform, which will provide a comprehensive understanding of the platform's features and functionalities.

## System Architecture
<a g="system-architecture"></a>
The Society management platform consists of three main components: the front end, the back end, and the database. The platform follows a client-server architecture, with the front end serving as the client and the back end and database serving as the server.

### Front-end 
<a h="front-end"></a>
The front end of the platform is built using ReactJS, ReactJS allows for the creation of dynamic and responsive user
interfaces, which are critical for providing an engaging learning experience to the students.
The front end communicates with the back end using RESTful API calls

### Back-end 
<a i="bront-end"></a>
The back end of the platform is built using NodeJS and ExpressJS,. The back end provides APIs for the front end to consume, which include functionalities such as user authentication, course creation, and course consumption. The back end also handles the logic for processing and storing the course content and user data.


### Database
<a j="database"></a>
The database for the platform is built using MySQL, which is a SQL database thatprovides a flexible and scalable data storage solution.It supports a wide range of operating systems, offers robust data security features, and provides seamless integration with numerous programming languages and platforms, making it a versatile solution for database management.

## Front End Technology
<a k="front-end-technology"></a>

The front end of Society Management has all the necessary pages that a tech platform for all the societies within the college should have. Some of these pages are:

### For Students:
<a k="for-students"></a>
* Homepage: This page will have a brief introduction to the platform, as well a list of all the societies of the college.
* Course List: This page will have a list of all the courses available on the platform,
along with their descriptions and ratings.
* Wishlist: This page will display all the courses that a student has added to their
wishlist.
* Cart Checkout: This page will allow the user to complete the course purchase.
* Course Content: This page will have the course content for a particular course,
including videos, and other related material.
* User Details: This page will have details about the student's account, including
their name, email, and other relevant information.
* User Edit Details: This page will allow the student to edit their account details.


### For Instructors:
<a k="for-instructors"></a>
* Dashboard: This page will have an overview of the instructor's courses, as well as
the ratings and feedback for each course.
* Insights: This page will have detailed insights into the instructor's courses,
including the number of views, clicks, and other relevant metrics.
* Course Management Pages: These pages will allow the instructor to create, update,
and delete courses, as well as manage the course content and pricing.
* View and Edit Profile Details: These pages will allow the instructor to view and edit
their account details.
PAGE 3
For Admin (this is for future scope):
* Dashboard: This page will have an overview of the platform's courses, instructors,
and students.
* Insights: This page will have detailed insights into the platform's metrics, including
the number of registered users, courses, and revenue.
* Instructor Management: This page will allow the admin to manage the platform's
instructors, including their account details, courses, and ratings.
* Other Relevant Pages: The admin will also have access to other relevant pages, such
as user management and course management pages.

To build the front end, we use frameworks and libraries such as ReactJS, We also use CSS and Tailwind, which are
styling frameworks that help make the user interface look good and responsive.
To manage the state of the application, we use Redux, which is a popular state management
library for React.
