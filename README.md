## Project Description
<a name="project-description"></a>
The primary objective of this project is to develop a module for our college societies. The website serves as a 
comprehensive platform to showcase the contributions and achievements of students, provide information about the 
society, list faculty coordinators and members, display testimonials, and advertise openings in the society and various other things.. The platform is built using the MERN stack, which includes
ReactJS, NodeJS, MySQL, and ExpressJS.

StudyNotion aims:
* To understand the fundamental components of society management.
* To explore effective practices for administrative management.
* To examine the role of technology in enhancing society management.
* To provide recommendations for improving society management 
systems.

In summary, Society Management is a versatile and intuitive tech platform that is designed to provide an immersive experience to students and a platform for society admins to maintain a complete record of their societies. In the following sections, we will delve into the technical details of the platform, which will provide a comprehensive understanding of the platform's features and functionalities.

## System Architecture
<a g="system-architecture"></a>
The Society management platform consists of three main components: the front end, the back end, and the database. The platform follows a client-server architecture, with the front end serving as the client and the back end and database serving as the server.

### Front-end 
<a h="front-end"></a>
The front end of the platform is built using ReactJS, ReactJS allows for the creation of dynamic and responsive user
interfaces, which are critical for providing an engaging learning experience to the students.
The front end communicates with the back end using RESTful API calls

### Back-end 
<a i="bront-end"></a>
The back end of the platform is built using NodeJS and ExpressJS,. The back end provides APIs for the front end to consume, which include functionalities such as user authentication, course creation, and course consumption. The back end also handles the logic for processing and storing the course content and user data.


### Database
<a j="database"></a>
The database for the platform is built using MySQL, which is a SQL database thatprovides a flexible and scalable data storage solution.It supports a wide range of operating systems, offers robust data security features, and provides seamless integration with numerous programming languages and platforms, making it a versatile solution for database management.
